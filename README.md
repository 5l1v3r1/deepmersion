## Motivation
Maintaining focus in today's world can often be extremely hard, with numerous distractions left, right and centre
often impeding one's ability from achieving the important objectives _(cf. performing well at hackathons)_. One incredible
resource for dealing with these issues are ambiental sound generators - the proper sound, in conjunction with noise-cancellation headphones,
can present an incredible boost to one's productivity indeed.

Unfortunately, we have found that existing solutions for ambient sound generations either restrict you to a certain fixed
sound ([rainymood.com](https://rainymood.com)), or an elaborate interface for mixing a multitude of sounds ([asoftmurmur.com](https://asoftmurmur.com)).
These options thus either give the user too little or too much choice---the former's imposed sound choice might not always be appropriate, while the
latter might cause significant time to be spent tuning the sound, thus inadvertently causing an additional distraction (as at least one of the creators
of this repository has experienced personally!).

Here we present [deepmersion.com](http://deepmersion.com)---a prototype of the 'one ambient sound generator to rule them all',
leveraging _three state-of-the-art neural network architectures_ to provide the user with the **optimal level of choice**.
